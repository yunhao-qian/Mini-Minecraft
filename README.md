# Mini Minecraft

This project implements a Qt-based C++ application that renders an interactive Minecraft-style world using OpenGL. The player can explore the environment in a free-flight mode or navigate with a physics-based system that simulates collisions, gravity, friction, and buoyancy. Realism is enhanced through procedurally generated terrain with mixed biomes, soft shadows, screen-space water reflections and refractions, atmospheric scattering, etc. The application runs in real-time on desktop or laptop systems equipped with a high-end GPU.

Here is a demo video about this application [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiAYUEdfHoc).
